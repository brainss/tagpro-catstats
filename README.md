# catstats

Save a tagpro scoreboard to `tsv`

### Install

To install:

* Download the [src.crx](https://github.com/ylambda/tagpro-catstats/blob/master/src.crx?raw=true) file (right click; save as)
* Open `Settings->Extensions` in chrome/chromium
* Drag and drop `src.crx` onto the extensions page
* Click add

### Usage

On the scoreboard a new link will appear to `Save as .tsv` Click this at
anytime to automatically save the scoreboard when the game ends. If a
player leaves at the end before you save, the scoreboard will still save
his/her stats.

This `tsv` file can be imported into a spreadsheet.
